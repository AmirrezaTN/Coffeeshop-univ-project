# CoffeeShop University Project
This is my **first** project at the university.    
This is *Object-oriented* code and I used classes and functions all by myself and I **didn't use** AI and get help from the websites. 
This code simulated the coffeeshop app that has manager and client objects, each of them having their unique features.
